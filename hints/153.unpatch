# Patch 152 and 153 do a lot of work with the assembler.
# It is combined into just 2 files, then patched. Going
# backwards, we'll just copy the 2.10.1 stuff and see if
# it works going back foward and adjust as needed.
#
# See 152.unpatch
#
# So here, we remove as2.s, and copy all the as2?.s
# files.
#
# Save p153 version for comparison
