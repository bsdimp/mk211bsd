#	rm -f /usr/include/a.out.h
#	rm -f /usr/include/nlist.h
#	rm -f /usr/include/ar.h
#	rm -f /usr/include/ranlib.h
#	rm -f /usr/include/short_names.h
# It also creates:
#	/usr/include/a.out.h
#	/usr/include/nlist.h
#	/usr/include/ar.h
#	/usr/include/ranlib.h
# So we can just copy over stuff from 2.10.1BSD or 4.3BSD and not worry about removal.

# But we have concluded that ar and ranlib, at last, came from 4.3BSD in the 2.11BSD
# release for the transition to portable archive format. a.out didn't change from
# 2.10.1 to 2.11, but did change in this series of patches, so we should grab it from
# 2.10.1. We also copy both places since I hypothosize that this is one of the sources
# of things getting out of sync in 175.
