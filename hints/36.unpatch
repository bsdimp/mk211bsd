# However, there's a note in the patch:
#	The GENERIC kernel wouldn't fit using the distributed Make.sunix
#	file - this was annoying since the dist kit obviously has a
#	GENERIC kernel on it.   Also, a reminder is added to both
#	the pdpstand/README and the pdpstand/Makefile to install a
#	'generic' version of /etc/dtab when building a GENERIC boot tape.
# So 2 things. (1) do we need to copy the un-patched dtab to /etc now?
# and (2) GENERIC makefile was afu, hence the need for this change, so apply
# our best guess as to how it was AFU'd based on the data we have from patch
# 2 b.1 file. We can't say for sure what BASE, OV1, OV2 and the first line of OV3
# are, so we'll have to test this reconstruction.  We can make close guesses,
# though, which is what this patch enshrines.
patch -V none -p1 < $HINTSDIR/36.GENERIC-Makefile.diff

# And then, we need to fix autoconfig after we've unpatched
#	Move the autoconfig routines into the /sys/autoconfig directory:
#		cd /sys/autoconfig
#		mv ../pdpuba/*auto* .
#		mv ../pdp/cnauto.c .
#		make tags
# So do the reverse and skip the make tags... With the files moved, make
# automatically adds the -I lines we need to rebuild autoconfig.
cd sys/autoconfig
mv cnauto.c ../pdp
mv *auto* ../pdpuba
