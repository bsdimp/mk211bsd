# ranlib is a hybrid of the 2.10.1 and the 4.3BSD one. ranlib still produced
# old-style tables, so pull it from 2.10.1 and apply hand crafted patch which
# replaces a few lines in main and the entire nextel, fixsize and fixdate
# functions.

# But there's a conflict, so i've cached a hand-applied version.
