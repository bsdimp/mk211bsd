# ur2.11BSD Testing

This tries to document the tests that I'm using to validate my
reconstruction. There's four major categories of testing. First is backwards
patch consistency. Is the reconstruction consistent with the patches going
backwards? Next is compile consistency: can the resulting system be built and
boot. Next is date consistency. Are the dates that the files wind up with
consistent with a product released in February or March 1991? Finally, there's
forward patch consistency. Can I start at the reconstructed sources and end with
patch 80? Patch 195? Does the catch-up kit work?

## Current status

All of the backward patch inconsistencies have been either corrected or
accounted for (or of little consequence).

There's one issue with nslookup that needs to be resolve on the build
consistency test. It's unclear if that needs to be resolved in favor of doing it
by hand, or if the binaries were just missing. I suspect this will be resolved
by hand since the binaries are quite popular.

There's one file that is not date consistent that need looking into. The system
is rebuilt in 1991 to help detect these issues. The current testing methodology
loses the dates from patch files, so we are not yet able to detect missing
patches to files that were patched after pl80 (we can detect it to 80 since the
catch-up kit has a complete set of patches). The dates of files patched aren't
updated by patch, so there's ~1184 files that have dates of 2020... While
important for the recreation, git doesn't retain date metadata, so we'll have to
look at other means.

There's still a few inconsistencies with patching to pl80 with the catch-up
kit. Those need to be documented. Mostly files that are expected to be present
by the upgrade scripts, but are not. It's unclear if some of the removals were a
just in case thing, or the files really were on the master tape. The bulk of the
remaining ones deal with local machine configuration. No attempt has been made
to walk the patches forward, nor deal with the multitude of added files in patch
80 that are no-where-else documented. No attempt has been made to go from patch
80 -> 195, or try to get close to patch 80 one patch at a time.

It's likely time to create github issues for the first two categories so they
aren't forgotten. The date and catch-up issues need to be burned down a bit more
and documented when the going gets slow there. Much code needs to be written to
do the patch-at-a-time upgrade.

# Backwards Patch Consistency

The very first test is 'is the reconstruction consistent with the patches'. This means, does anything in the patches contradict what has been reconstructed. Examples of this are the patches not apply, applying with unexplained fuzz or line number deltas.

Now that all the patches apply w/o error, I've narrowed the scope of this test. The test is to grep for the words offset or fuzz in the log files:

        % egrep 'Hunk.*offset|fuzz' log/*
        log/124.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 69 with fuzz 1 (offset 2 lines).
        log/124.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 55 (offset 1 line).
        log/142.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 50 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
        log/142.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 50 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
        log/152.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 265 (offset 1 line).
        log/152.log:Hunk #2 succeeded at 313 (offset 1 line).
        log/152.log:Hunk #3 succeeded at 354 (offset 1 line).
        log/152.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 230 (offset 1 line).
        log/152.log:Hunk #2 succeeded at 265 (offset 1 line).
        log/152.log:Hunk #3 succeeded at 284 (offset 1 line).
        log/159.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 109 with fuzz 2 (offset 27 lines).
        log/159.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 109 with fuzz 2 (offset 27 lines).
        log/174.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 540 (offset 6 lines).
        log/174.log:Hunk #2 succeeded at 563 (offset 6 lines).
        log/174.log:Hunk #3 succeeded at 579 (offset 6 lines).
        log/174.log:Hunk #4 succeeded at 617 with fuzz 1 (offset 6 lines).
        log/42.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 336 (offset -1 lines).
        log/42.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 177 (offset -155 lines).
        log/84.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 325 (offset -1 lines).
        log/84.log:Hunk #2 succeeded at 377 (offset -1 lines).
        log/84.log:Hunk #1 succeeded at 215 (offset -156 lines).

This indicates that there's 21 issues that need explaining in some way. Based on
the current text below, they either don't matter for the reconstruction back to
0 (but may when we forward apply things) or are likely harmless (4 issues that
are very low priority).

## What it means

Fuzz is the number of lines ignored in the patch to apply it for the
non-changing part. This suggests minor changes around the code that's
changing. Each should be investigated. Often, it's white space, but sometimes it
can be more.

Offset means that it expected the patch to start at line X but instead it started at X+offset. When offset is possitive, it indicates lines added (though offset 1 is quite often a blank line). When negative, it means code was deleted. The larger the number, the more cause for concern. Very large numbers can also just indicate code motion and not any substantial changes.

Here's an analysis of each of the errors.

### 174.log false positive

        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------

        Hunk #3 succeeded at 579 (offset 6 lines).
        Hunk #4 succeeded at 617 with fuzz 1 (offset 6 lines).
        Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
        done

This is the result of creating this patch from the patch to
sendmail/src/daemon.c. It would have been required to build/run sendmail.MX on
2.11BSD.

### 159.log doesn't matter
        Patching QT/Makefile
        Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------

        Hunk #1 succeeded at 109 with fuzz 2 (offset 27 lines).
        done
        Patching SMS/Makefile
        Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile.old	Sun Jul  4 21:27:00 1993
        |--- /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile	Sat Jan 22 16:39:46 1994
        --------------------------
        Patching file Makefile using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 109 with fuzz 2 (offset 27 lines).
        done

Changes to generated Makefile for both the QT and SMS files. QT disappears in the patch 93 or so. We regenerate SMS at patch 93, so these both can be ignored.

### 152.log Likely harmless
        Hmm...  The next patch looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |diff -c as.old/as19.s as/as19.s
        |*** as.old/as19.s	Tue Aug 22 20:14:29 1989
        |--- as/as19.s	Wed Dec 13 10:23:35 1989
        --------------------------
        Patching file as19.s using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 265 (offset 1 line).
        Hunk #2 succeeded at 313 (offset 1 line).
        Hunk #3 succeeded at 354 (offset 1 line).
        Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
        done
        Hmm...  The next patch looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |diff -c as.old/as29.s as/as29.s
        |*** as.old/as29.s	Tue Aug 22 17:12:29 1989

        Patching file as29.s using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 230 (offset 1 line).
        Hunk #2 succeeded at 265 (offset 1 line).
        Hunk #3 succeeded at 284 (offset 1 line).
        Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.

I've looked into this and I think it's a blank line that's causing this at the start of the file, but I need to double check and confirm. The resulting as0.s and as2.s files are no different in later patches. This is likely harmless, but would be good to know why.

### 142.log doesn't matter

        Patching QT/Makefile
        Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile.old	Sun Jun  6 21:51:24 1993
        |--- /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile	Sun Jun  6 21:48:32 1993
        --------------------------
        Patching file Makefile using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 50 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
        done
        Patching SMS/Makefile
        Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile.old	Sun Jun  6 21:51:24 1993
        |--- /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile	Sun Jun  6 21:48:32 1993
        --------------------------
        Patching file Makefile using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 50 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
        done

Same files with offsets as for 159.log. Likely doesn't matter for same reasons. Though fuzz and offset is otherwise concerning and may indicate deeper issues that need to be investigated for the trip back through the patches.

### 124.log doesn't matter

        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/SMS/Makefile.old	Sat Dec 26 22:26:30 1992
        |--- /usr/src/sys/SMS/Makefile	Fri Mar 12 19:03:53 1993
        --------------------------
        Patching file usr/src/sys/SMS/Makefile using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 69 with fuzz 1 (offset 2 lines).
        Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
        done
        Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile.old	Tue Dec 29 00:44:28 1992
        |--- /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile	Fri Mar 12 19:03:39 1993
        --------------------------
        Patching file usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 55 (offset 1 line).
        Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
        done

The Makefiles (generated files) have become out of sync by one line. There's an additional line inserted in the first 55 lines of the template or similar. Given the amount of hand editing, I'll likely just document this as 'weird' in the end. For both of these, it's not a huge deal: we regenerate them at patch 93.

### 84.log likely harmless

        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /sys/conf/KAZOO.old	Sun Dec 22 16:11:27 1991
        |--- /sys/conf/KAZOO	Thu Nov 19 21:06:53 1992
        --------------------------
        Patching file sys/conf/KAZOO using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 325 (offset -1 lines).
        Hunk #2 succeeded at 377 (offset -1 lines).
        Hmm...  The next patch looks like a new-style context diff to me...
        The text leading up to this was:
        The text leading up to this was:
        --------------------------
        |*** /sys/conf/VAX.old	Sun Dec 22 16:12:46 1991
        |--- /sys/conf/VAX	Tue Oct 13 20:46:49 1992
        --------------------------
        Patching file sys/conf/VAX using Plan A...
        No such line 370 in input file, ignoring
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 215 (offset -156 lines).

KAZOO is a best effort reconstruction. This suggests a small error in reconstructing it. Likely harmless, but maybe some attention is needed.

VAX is a no-effort reconstruction that's known to be badly off.
          
### 42.log likely harmless
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/conf/KAZOO.old	Wed Dec 19 10:12:43 1990
        |--- /usr/src/sys/conf/KAZOO	Sun Dec 22 16:11:27 1991
        --------------------------
        Patching file usr/src/sys/conf/KAZOO using Plan A...
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 336 (offset -1 lines).
        --------------------------
        |*** /usr/src/sys/conf/VAX.old	Sat Aug 12 21:58:07 1989
        |--- /usr/src/sys/conf/VAX	Sun Dec 22 16:12:46 1991
        --------------------------
        Patching file usr/src/sys/conf/VAX using Plan A...
        No such line 331 in input file, ignoring
        Hunk #1 succeeded at 177 (offset -155 lines).

Same as 84.log.

# Build Tests

We know that the 2.11BSD happened. If we're trying to reconstruct the sources to it, then they should build. We also know that at the time certain practices were in place. We need to determine if any build breakage was 'worked around' by these practices or if it indicates a problem in my reconstruction.

I established the following criteria:
 1. Does the breakage stop the build from completing? If so, then it's a bad reconstruction.
 1. Can a clean tree rebuild entirely?
 1. Could a 'dirty' tree cause the build to succeed? That is, if it complains something is missing, then is there a way to recreate the missing thing via make? If so, then one could pluasuably state that it could have gone unnoticed in the release. Rebuilding everything took more than a day, and according to notes in the patches, was undertaken about once a year.
 1. Is the breakage fixed later? Patches 106 to 116 fixed numerous build breakages and irregularities. Generally, I've opted to reconstruct as if those parts had been built by hand (mostly man pages, though I'm not sure what to do about the ns* utilties)
 1. Anything that it doesn't know to make?

## Known errors

### Don't know how to make clean. Stop.

There's a number of makefiles that don't know how to make clean. These errors
are all ignored by the build system, so are believed to be expected and
normal. This happens three times. But the root cause is in the
src/usr.lib/sendmail/lib/Makefile, which actually does not know how to make
clean.

### rmdir: tmp: no such file or directory Exit 1 (ignored)
        rmdir: tmp: No such file or directory
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

In libc, the Makefiles use a tmp directory to do the build. It's removed, and rm returns an error since the file isn't there. This error is ignored and totally expected.

### Exit 1 (ignored) in me
        if [ ! -d /usr/lib/me ]; then  rm -f /usr/lib/me;  mkdir /usr/lib/me;  fi
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This blows away the installed macro environment styles and recreates them. This error is expected.

### Exit 1 (ignored) in f77

        mkstr - f77_strings xx equiv.c
        cc -S -w -DTARGET=PDP11 -DFAMILY=DMR -DHERE=PDP11 -DOUTPUT=BINARY  -DPOLISH=POSTFIX -DOVERLAID -DC_OVERLAY               xxequiv.c
        mv xxequiv.s equiv.s
        if [ X-i = X-n ]; then ed - equiv.s < :rofix; fi
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This is fixing up the error messages when building separate binaries. This error is expected due to the limitations in /bin/sh that's in 2.11BSD as shipped.

### Exit 10 (ignored) in jove

        ./setmaps < keymaps.txt > keymaps.c
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-1".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-2".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-3".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-4".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-5".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-6".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-7".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-8".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-9".
        Warning: cannot find command "select-buffer-10".
        *** Exit 10 (ignored)

Another expected error.

### Exit 1 (ignored) in learn

        mkdir /usr/lib/learn  /usr/lib/learn/log  /usr/lib/learn/bin
        mkdir: /usr/lib/learn: File exists
        mkdir: /usr/lib/learn/log: File exists
        mkdir: /usr/lib/learn/bin: File exists
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

Learn is trying to make directories that already exist. The lack of -p is what causes this.

### Exit 1 (ignored) find

        install -s find /usr/bin/find
        mkdir /usr/lib/find
        mkdir: /usr/lib/find: File exists
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This directory does exist, so this an expected error.

### Exit 1 (ignored) rwho

        mkdir /usr/spool/rwho
        mkdir: /usr/spool/rwho: File exists
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This directory does exist, so this an expected error.

### Exit 1 (ignored) ex
        mkdir /usr/preserve
        mkdir: /usr/preserve: File exists
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This directory does exist, so this an expected error.

### Exit 1 (ignored) battlestar
        install -c battlestar.6 /usr/man/man6/battlestar.6
        install: can't find battlestar.6.
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This file indeed does not exist here. It's one of the files that patch 106 moves back to live in /usr/src/games/battlestar. So this is expected and also fixed later.

### Exit 1 (ignored) phantasia
        mkdir /usr/games/lib/phantasia
        mkdir: /usr/games/lib/phantasia: File exists
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

This directory does exist, so this an expected error.

### Exit 1 (ignored) warp
        mv /usr/games/warp /usr/games/warp.old
        mv: /usr/games/warp: Cannot access: No such file or directory
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

this is expected. We remove warp as part of the build process so we don't wind up with a warp.old dated in 1994 on the image.

### Exit 1 (ignored) warp
        if test ! -f `./filexp /usr/games/lib/warp/warp.news`; then  cp warp.news `./filexp /usr/games/lib/warp`;  fi
        *** Exit 1 (ignored)

Also an expected exit value due to limitations in /bin/sh

### Exit 1 in nslookup
        for i in tools; do  (cd $i; make -k clean);  done
        sh: tools: bad directory
        *** Exit 1

This error is a real error. It's fixed in the 106-116 line of patches. It's
unclear if we should just build/install by hand or not for this one give the
high visibility of the missing pieces. It's highly likely that this was test
built, test installed before a full build, so the binaries were on the
system. This suggests that the build2.sh build orchestration should do that too.

# Date Test

To test this, I use the following
	# date 9104151234
	# ^D to boot to multiuser
	login: root
	# touch /now
        # find / -newer /now -ls | grep -v ' 2020 ' | colrm 1 42

Most recnetly this generated the following:

There's 42 items in this list. Let's unpack them one at a time. '*' means
there's little to no value in the file because it's part of a running system, or
left over junk. 'c' are genreated config files. 'R' are files that are
regenerated. 'o' can be reconstructed from the old release.

## Today's date

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Apr 15 12:35 | /usr/adm/acct |
| Apr 15 12:35 | /usr/spool/lpd.lock |

## Directories

These files are directories, so their dates might be messed up:

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Mar 10  1993 | /usr/doc/2.10/setup.2.11 |
| Jan  9  1993 | /usr/preserve |
| Jan 15  1993 | /usr/include/OLD |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/spool/mail |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/spool/rwho |
| Apr  8  1994 | /usr/spool/uucp/LCK |
| Dec 19  1991 | /usr/spool/uucp/STST |
| Apr  3  1994 | /usr/spool/uucp/C. |
| Apr  3  1994 | /usr/spool/uucp/D.sms |
| Apr  3  1994 | /usr/spool/uucp/D.smsX |

One would think that /usr/include/OLD is something that should be deleted, but
the files are needed for ps. It's unclear why / how that wound up with a future
date, though, since we patch one of the files in it. It's contents are
fine. There's other docs that tell use there's only two files in here for ps.

The UUCP ones are all empty directories. They likely can just be deleted since
at least the D.sms* ones are local to the master machine that made the
tapes. The others I believe are created as needed, and so there'd be no harm in
deleting them. We could create them as part of the build process. There was some
other directories that were deleted in the catch-up patch, so those will be
recreated when that bug is fixed. Getting this detail right, though, likely has
minimal benefit.

The rest of these directories can likely just be deleted. At least /var/preserve
and /usr/spool/rwho would get recreated (since there's an ignored error now for
these two in the build). We can likely recreate all of them as part of the build
process and lose no data. They would have been created at the time the tape was
made. We know it was made in Jan-Mar of 1991, btw. There's a odd lack of files
from 1991 on this release that happened in March....

## Other UUCP files

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Feb 16  1994 | /usr/lib/uucp/SEQF |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE |

These are related to UUCP. LOGFILE and SEQF appear to be uninteresting. L.sys
has some mild historical interest, but it's basically how to log into the remove
systems (and likely should never have been in the distribution). The one from
the 195 tape appears to have a live number and username and password. The old
one likely had similar info, and is lost to time. It's not patched in any patch,
nor in the catchup patches. It's likely best replaced by the one from 2.10.1BSD,
which looks like a suitable dummy file.

## Lpd files

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Dec 28  1991 | /usr/spool/lpd/errs |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/spool/lpd/acct |
| Jun 21  1994 | /usr/spool/lpd/.seq |
| Jun 21  1994 | /usr/spool/lpd/status |
| Apr 15 12:35 | /usr/spool/lpd.lock |

These files are incidental to lpd running. They are uninteresting other than to have weird dates.

## Config files

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/Pnews |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/config.sh |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/config.h |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/Rnmail |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/newsetup |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/newsgroups |
| Jun 10  1992 | /usr/src/new/rn/newsnews |
| Dec 24  1991 | /usr/src/games/warp/UU/myread |
| Dec 24  1991 | /usr/src/games/warp/UU/grimble |

These likely need to be regenerated as part of buid2.sh, but the rn Configure
program is difficult to run. warp is easier, but also needs to run.

## man whatis database

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Jul 17  1994 | /usr/man/whatis |

This needs to be regenerated. Unfortunately the script that does this in 2.11BSD
pl 0 runs out of memory. We may need to find some way to generate it on the
FreeBSD host.

## Changes after 2.10.1

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Dec 30  1992 | /usr/lib/crontab |
| Jul 12  1994 | /usr/lib/aliases |

These files most liklely were unchanged from 2.10.1. Or, if not, that's the most
likely reconstruction in absense of other data. aliases just has one change, and
crontab was reformatted a bit, but is substantially simmilar.

## Bottom line...

Here's the filtered list of what I think might be interesting.

| Date | File |
|------|------|
| Jul 17  1994 | /usr/man/whatis |

whatis can't build on pdp-11, so it's stale. For the release reconstruction, I
think we need to find a way to build it. But at least it's well known.

# Boot test failures

The tmscpboot stuff is broken.

The pl80 catchup reconstruction hasn't been tested.
